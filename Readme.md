# Python Challenge

This is the first python code for the bootcamp. There are two subfolders PyBank and PyPoll that can be run to analyse two similar CSV files and summarise the data. The summary will be displayed in the terminal and saved to an output file in the analysis directory.

## PyBank

PyBank will summarise data with a date and profit/loss amount:

* Total months
* Total amount
* Average Change
* Greatest increase in profits between two months
* Greatest decrease in profits between two months

## PyPoll

PyPoll will summarise data with a Ballot ID, County and Candidate:

* Total Votes
* Total Votes for each candidate and percentage of the total
* Winner
